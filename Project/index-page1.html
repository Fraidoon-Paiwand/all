      <h1 class="h11">How to create multiple pages in HTML</h1>
      <hr />
      <br />
      <p>
        Learn how to create multiple pages in HTML with three easy-to-follow
        steps.
      </p>
      <h1 class="h12">Step 1: Create a folder</h1>
      <br />
      <hr />
      <p>
        The first step is to add a folder. A folder stores all your pages in one
        place and makes it easier to organize your project. To create a folder
        in Visual Studio Code, click the
        <span class="span1">Explorer</span> icon on the left sidebar and click
        the new folder icon. You can name the folder however you like, and in
        this guide, I call it <span>business-website</span> as an example only.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h1 class="h13">Step 2: Create an HTML file</h1>
      <br />
      <hr />
      <p>
        The second step is to add HTML files. The HTML files will serve as a
        page of the website, and you can have as many pages as you like. In this
        guide, we will make only four web pages. <br />
        <br />
        To do that, first, add a new HTML file inside the folder, and we will
        name it index.html. That will be your homepage, and it is crucial to
        call it an index because when the webserver first loads your site, it
        will search for index.html by default. <br />
        <br />
        Next, add three other HTML files and give the filenames as about.html,
        service.html, and contact.html. Make sure that all these files are in
        the same folder.
      </p>

      <h1 class="h14">Step 3: Create a navigation bar</h1>
      <br>
      <hr>
      <p>Okay, you are almost there! The only thing left is to add a navigation bar in all HTML web pages so that the visitors can navigate your website. <br>
        <br>
        To create a navigation bar, add the nav elements inside the body elements. Inside the nav elements, create a navigation link by adding the a elements, and each link should have the href attribute where the value is the name of the HTML file. <br>
        <br>
        For example, to link a contact page, you do like this: <br>
        <br>
        a href="./contact.html">Contact</a>
        The final code should look like this in every HTML file.
