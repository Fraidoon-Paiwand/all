      <p>
        What is a Multi-page Website? A multi-page website features more than
        one page. These are the sites youâ€™ll be familiar with, where clicking on
        a link takes you to a new page. Think of Amazon, eBay or Walmart:
      </p>
      <br />
      <hr />
      <br />
      <p>
        This is a multi-page website means that I have more page like index (the
        Home page) We make this same but the different is you can't use the
        exact same name. you can change the name by adding one thing using
        (Number, signs, letters) for example index is your homepage and index1
        is your page you can use that but it will confuse you later on, so
        select a perfect name to not confuse later. For example like the
        index-page1. Most people use this name but I suggest you the easy name
        that you can remember later on. For learning how to create multi-pages
        click onto the about to go to the next page.
